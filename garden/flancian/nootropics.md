# Nootropics
- I only really consume caffeine. After reading gwern's take (https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics) I'm more likely to replace coffee with tea for the l-theanine, or get l-theanine supplements.
    - [ ] Get l-theanine.
- Modafinil sounds suspiciously good as a "first aid kit" for when you slept badly/not at all.
- [x] Creatine supposedly makes sense as well -- need to look into it.
    - [ ] Get creatine.
