    - **Then**, if you have not already, **please set up your subscription payment on OpenCollective via **[**this link**](https://opencollective.com/socialcoop). The fee is sliding scale $1-10/month, and setting up payments on an annual rather than monthly cycle saves our co-op a bit in terms of transaction fees.

To be an effective co-operative, **it's important that members participate in its governance** by generally keeping informed on the goings on and strategic direction of [social.coop](http://social.coop). To take part, please **request to join the members Loomio group**** **[**via this link**](https://www.loomio.org/socialcoop/)**. Note: **when you register on Loomio, please include your Social.Coop username so we can recognize your as a member.
    - You’re getting this email from me because I’m the member of the Community Working Group Operations Team who is on-call this week. Feel free to follow up if you have any issues; my handle on the instance is @Matt_Noyes.
