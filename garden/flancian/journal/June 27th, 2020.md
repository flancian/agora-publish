- [[AbstractFairy]] told me about being an atheist in Egypt and the [[Egypt-Ethiopia conflict]].
- [x] Need to fix my i3 key mapping so that cycling through workspaces only affects the active display, and alt+j/k switch displays instead of moving displays (that should be shift+alt+j/k).
- Should read more about [[Language Games]]
- VC with [[nthd3gr33]]
- Met [[Yakomo]]
