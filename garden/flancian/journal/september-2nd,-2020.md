- [[EduneV]] introduced me to [[lucid innocence]]: About "knowing how to play Machiavellian games" I was a bit uncertain too, but it reminds me to a term I like: "lucid innocence" which is about the ability to cause harm and not doing it vs the kind of innocence that is unable of causing harm. I think there's something that the shadows offer in terms of wisdom, even if you don't bring them to presence, you know about them.
- I can't believe I just head about the [[Fediverse]]
- Should read more about [[Epicurus]]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus
