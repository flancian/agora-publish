# May 16th, 2020
- I think today is going to be a great day. Plan:
    - [x] Buy presents for others.
    - [x] Donate.
    - [x] Continue with my 20% contribution.
    - [ ] Write something, no matter how trivial, in Clojure.
    - That's probably enough for a day :) Perhaps for a few. But I'll give it a try.
- Today I met [[EduneV]]
- Today I was in a call with [[Athens]] people.
