- 73% of people think I should not bother with [[Ayn Rand]]: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1267403773149958150
    - [[Adam Fitchett]] implied reading [[The Virtue of Selfishness]] might be worth it due to high signal/noise.
    - Due to this poll, the likelihood I will read any of her novels has gone down.
- I should write "[[Context]]", a Chrome Extension that for example replaces dollar amounts with the potential impact of that sum as applied to some constructive/charitable goal (e.g. against malaria/saving lives).
