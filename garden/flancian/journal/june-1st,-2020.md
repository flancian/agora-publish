# June 1st, 2020
- Discussed [[How to become a Flancian]] and [[Wittgenstein Protocol]] with L.; she had good insights.
- Was introduced to [[John Cowper Powys]] by [[Codex]].
- Was pointed to [[The Virtue of Selfishness]] by [[Adam Fitchett]] as a good summary of Ayn Rand's thinking.
    - My a priori is that overall I dislike Randian thinking; might be worth reading this and corroborating/refuting.
