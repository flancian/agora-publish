# August 24th, 2020
- Renewed anagora.org for two years. By impulse went up to two years, then checked what I had done for flancia.org back in July -- two years as well. I forget but I am sometimes consistent.
- Vi parte de https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyRaDJwP1u4 con Lu, sobre [[Macedonio Fernandez]]
- Anot√© idea de regalo para [[G.]]
- [[TODO]]: research open source ways of drawing 1. protocol diagrams and 2. graph visualizations. Is dia the best there is, or should I use something higher level? This is sort of implicitly blocking calling my [[Go Links]] post finished.
- Found https://github.com/thomaswang/minimal-twitter, could be a good base for [[Meritocracy]].
