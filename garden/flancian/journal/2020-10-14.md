 - [[Agora v0.5]]: publishing
    - [ ] I still have the problem that gatsby-digital-garden does not play well with having notes in many different paths. I should fix it or look elsewhere?
      - Alternative: https://github.com/yenly/foamy-nextjs
    - [ ] Another problem: some pages aren't found.
      - [[Stephen Wolfram]] is found.
      - [[X]] is not (what is X?)
    - Probably need to learn [[Gatsby]] proper today, or part of it. Go through a tutorial?
     - Read about underlying technologies: [[React]], [[GraphQL]]
    - Perhaps should at least check out the [[React]] docs as well.
 - [ ] I'd like to cook [[Baingan Bharta]].
 - [ ] I need to order more coffee
