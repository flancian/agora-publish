- Started work again. Trying to take it easier. So far so good :)
- Organized my flancia.org email. Procrastination of course, but at least constructive.
- I still don't know why or how the Roam pinned tab in Firefox becomes unpinned so often and it's driving me a bit crazy. I can't reproduce it consciously.
