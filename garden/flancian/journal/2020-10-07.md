# 2020-10-07

 - [[foam]]: changed "new note directory" to WORKSPACE_ROOT to try to prevent the issue in which notes created by linking from the diary are created in journal/. Let's try it:
    - Interacted with [[TheEquitableProse]] on [[twitter]].
    - It worked :)
 - [[Agora v1]]: perhaps it should be called Agora v0.5? Following Semantic Versioning, I think.
 - [[Agora v1]]: perhaps its web version could "just" be based on https://github.com/cdr/code-server? I wonder how expensive running a [[code-server]] per user could be.
 - [[theanine]]: took at 11:40 AM. Unsure if I took it earlier -- an issue with having it on my desk and sometimes taking it as I'm engrossed in a different task. To prevent this from happening again I moved it away from my desk.
 - [[Charles Stanhope]] told me about [[indieweb]]: https://social.coop/web/statuses/104959656532080052.
 - Wrote a hacky script to add headers to notes that were missing them, [[addheader.py]].
 - [[dyokomizo]] told me about [[holonomy]].
