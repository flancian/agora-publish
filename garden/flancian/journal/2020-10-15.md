# 2020-10-15

 - VC with [[Jeff Tang]]. It was great!
   - Told me about [[Nate Liason]]
   - See also todos in note proper (this is where block references would come in handy).
 - [[S.]] came over and we had concurrent mate (different gourds) with social distancing.
 - [[LJ]] unbanned me and pointed me to their actually pretty great and reasonable bot policy: https://www.livejournal.com/bots/
 - [[scottjoe]] in [[foam]] [[discord]]: @Flancian interesting. As long as they're accessible to you and your credentials in your local environment, it'd clone them all into the bottles directory with whatever they come with. I've made mine in a way that they're all sort of...content plugins/sources for my overall workspace. As long as Foam doesn't conflict in some way with the workspace mgmt found in each of those tools (assuming you're wanting to keep them as working [obsidian|athens|roam] workspaces s well)
