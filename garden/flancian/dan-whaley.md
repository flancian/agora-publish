 # Questions
- Journey to understand the broad frame.
  - There is a movement in humanity towards networked thinking.
  - The book -> the telephone -> the web.
  - What's next? There's another step coming. The beginning of truly coordinated semantic thinking.
  - Dan believes that the note taking paradigm with wiki links is a key part of this journey but it needs an ingredient.
    - Standards.
    - Open coordination.
    - Federation.
  - Annotation is the *edge*. An event horizon.
    - The ability to coordinate between clients that live at the edge is key.
    - Does not yet have the power of the wiki link.
  - Notion/Roam are not yet unlocking the full human potential.
    - Dan is on a journey to find what are the essential components.
  - Open questions: groups, groups permissions.
  - Hypothesis gets tweeted at by people who are using their tools in new ways.
 - John Gilmore.
   - Local cyberpunk guy, founder of Sun Microsystems.
   - Lots of different annotation services; how do you know which annotation services have annotations with a page?
   - Similar problem to go link authorities.
   - DHT.
 - Del.ic.ious. 

# Backlinks
 - Some people think that the fact that backlinks were absent in the original web was part of what let it grow.

 # Risks
  - What if in the future you can't just run a server in your closet?
  - W3C
    - Hypothes.is is part of it
    - [[Tim Berners Lee]] holds it together.
    - Community group -> working group
    - [[Ivan Herman]]
      - Senior staff at W3C
    - Community group is outside the W3C, but blessed. Build a community, clear plan. Then you're invited to a working group.
  - Browser vendors consortium (name?)
    - Conveniently outside the W3C.

# Todo
    - Annotation standard: read it
      - Data model
        - JSON/RDF: elements that needs to make up an annotation
      - Protocol
        - Rest
      - Vocabulary
        - What are the concepts in this space.

# One idea
 - A discrete component.
 - Glorified markdown editors.
 - Hypothes.is -> readwise -> Roam
    -  Hypothes.is as a SGK client
    -  Standards compliant wiki service

 # Social Networks
 - Dan agrees that most of the activity is socially beneficial.
 - People still think of these networks as being apart from themselves. But the network is the organism.

# Topics
 - Tagging.
   - Everything2.com.
 - Open source versions of projects.
   - Athens.
   - Truly networked paradigm?
 - Loose coupling / loose integration.
 - My view: personal gardens are what get a critical mass. It needs to be independent.
