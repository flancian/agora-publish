- Obvious time to do it is Friday afternoon. Doing it then lets you "clean up" and go into the weekend confident that you are in a good shape.

- On Monday morning, you are refreshed; you can use it to ease into the week.
- **Be kind to yourself.**
- [[David Allen]]: "the weekly review is the critical success factor for marrying your larger commitments to your day-to-day activities."
