# Swiss Wiring Code
- For electrical systems; relevant mostly for installing lamps in my case. Source: https://www.englishforum.ch/other-general/160978-swiss-wire-coding-electricity.html
- Green/Yellow = Earth
- Light Blue (or yellow in old systems) = Neutral
- Black, White or Red = Live
- All colours (except green/yellow, Light Blue and Yellow) = Switched Live.
