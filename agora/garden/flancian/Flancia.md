# Flancia
- My amateur [[utopia]].
- It is a world in which everybody that can (is privileged enough to be able to do so), helps others, some of their time.
- Also a place in my mind.
- In this place there is an [[Agora]].
- In this place there is a tool: the [[Assistant]].
- In this place there is a third thing: [[Thing]].
- Flancia also has a [[Flancia (narrative)]].
