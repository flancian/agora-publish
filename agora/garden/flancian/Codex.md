# Codex
- A tool, but also a [[person]] named Iian (with two Is) on [[twitter]].
- https://twitter.com/codexeditor
- Introduced me to [[Luca Landucci]], [[Standoff properties]], [[TEI]]
- Into [[Dune]]: https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1287377076090048512
- I like his "crazy codex ideas" series: https://flancia.org/t/codexeditor/crazy
- Had a really nice talk about the Codex editor over VC one day, but apparently forgot to write about it in the diary.
