# Some Possible Paths to Flancia
- [[Agora]]
    - The Agora as a tool for constructive magical thinking
    - Three example Agoras
    - How they could interop
    - Stoas, gardens, circles.
    - Application: UBI
        - Short term BI experiments
        - GiveDirectly
        - Group incomes
    - Application: freeing the internet
        - Profit distribution: Coca Cola doesn't really care which specific platform users are in
        - Flanbook
    - Groups as RPG parties
        - Roles in a project
        - Explorer, miner, toolmaker/artisan
- The [[Tools of the Agora]]
    - A contract
    - A protocol
    - An assistant
- [[Flancia]] is what [[Flancians]] could build using an [[Agora]]
    - Honest, earnest, kind-hearted people doing their best.
    - Belief as a tool for cooperation
- What we need to build Flancia is more Flancians. Flancia is the bolo of Flancians.
