    - Here are some links while I remember: [Ask, Guess](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2Fvs3kzjLhbdKsndnBy%2Fask-and-guess) and [Tell Culture](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FrEBXN3x6kXgD4pLxs%2Ftell-culture)
    - [Street Epistemology](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstreetepistemology.com%2F) (I have not checked out this website in particular as I just heard Russian friends talking about so it might not be a great intro)
    - [Circling](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FaFyWFwGWBsP5DZbHF%2Fcircling)I'll definitely check out __Utopia For Realists__, and your projects [anagora.org](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fanagora.org) and [flancia.org](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflancia.org)It was really cool chatting about all that maybe we should repeat it some time!
