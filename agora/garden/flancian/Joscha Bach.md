    - Born/raised in East Germany ([[outsider]])

    - Neurons, like all cells, are like individual organisms evolved to reap rewards; they self-adjust to trigger on the right stimuli, which results in them being "reinforced": getting fatter.
    - Doesn't believe in the self/identity; probably an advanced meditator.
    - One's attention is focused by default on instances in which our internal models of the world fail to predict it accurately. In a sense introspection and fascination with mental processes is a symptom of maladjustment.
