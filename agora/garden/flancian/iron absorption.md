    - **Conclusions:** This study shows 
that tea consumed simultaneously with an iron-containing porridge meal 
leads to decreased nonheme iron absorption and that a 1-h time interval 
between a meal and tea consumption attenuates the inhibitory effect, 
resulting in increased nonheme iron absorption. These findings are not 
only important in relation to the management of iron deficiency but 
should also inform dietary advice, especially that given to those at 
risk of deficiency. This trial was registered at [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov) as NCT02365103.
