 - I liked it, tried it after Roam -- but it's not open source, so not sure if worth it over something like Foam.
 - Foam seems more easily extensible to me.
 - This thread was what sealed the deal, didn't make it sound like open source was likely to happen anytime soon: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/open-sourcing-of-obsidian/1515
