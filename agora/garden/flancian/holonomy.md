# Holonomy

 - Holonomy: “In this theory, a system is called ‘holonomic’ if, in a certain sense, one can recover global information from local information, so the meaning "entire-law" is quite appropriate.” I like to use this word to describe coordination problems, as I see those as mostly failures to project local preferences into global contexts. e.g. states can coordinate large scale projects (e.g. moon landing, airports) in ways that individuals and markets can’t usually.
 - [[dyokomizo]] thinks this is related to [[coordination problems]].
