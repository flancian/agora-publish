# Carrot Cake

- 1.5 cup flour
4 tsp baking powder
0.5 tsp salt
1.5 tsp cinnamon
(0.25 tsp each of ground nutmeg and cloves if you have)

~1.1 cup sugar
~0.9 cup oil
3 eggs

300g carrots
~1 cup nuts, chopped, roasted a bit

bake at 175C/350F for 35 mins or so
- first you mix the dry and wet ingredients separately, then mix them together, you know the drill

then you fold in the carrots and nuts (I use almonds bc they're relatively cheap, recipes say pecans)
- I'm pretty sure you could round the sugar and oil to 1 cup but haven't tried, that will be the last step to perfection next time I think
