# Interintellect
- Founded by [[Anna Gat]]
- Centered around [[Salons]] -- relatively exclusive events you have to pay a low fee to attend.
- I dislike the name, a lot. I dislike the whole 'niche', 'intellectual' aspect of it.
- [[evaricweicksel]] likes it though, and he seems cool.
- [[visakanv]] apparently also likes it.
- I have no idea if I'm in it -- I joined it early, then never heard about it, and [[Anna Gat]] didn't seem interested in interacting with me at all. Yet I received a ping from a random person on Twitter offering a beta program for members of it (?).
- interintellect.org is the Mattermost instance.
