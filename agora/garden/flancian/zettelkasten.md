- Steps
    - Take [[literature]] notes. Information I don't want to forget or think I can use later. Ideally no copy/paste.
    - Take [[bibliographical]] notes.
    - Make [[permanent]] notes. Go over notes in previous notes and think about how they relate to my thinking, research, interest. Find meaninful connections. This builds a web of knowledge.
    - Find keywords: think about "when will this be useful", "when and how will I use this idea". Ideally they relate to topics I'm working on.
- Take fleeting notes: this is just an idea log.
