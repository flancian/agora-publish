- Introduction
    - p1 This book grew out of an intellectual detour that became so gripping that I decided to abandon my original itinerary altogether.
    - Originally set out to "understand why the state has always seemed to be the enemy of "people who move around", to put it crudely.
    - Gypsies, berbers, bedouins, vagrants, homeless, serfs "have always been a thorn in the side of states".
    - Efforts to permanently settle these mobile people are perennial and seldom succeed.
    - p2 on many of these schemes: "the state's attempt to make a society legible, to arrange the population in ways that simplified the classic state functions of taxation, conscription and prevention of rebellion". Creation of grids.
    - Beekeeping as an analogy. Industrial hives are made regular, segregated.
    - p3 [[Chandigarth]]
