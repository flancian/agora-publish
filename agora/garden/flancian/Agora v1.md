# Agora V1
- Superseded by [[Agora v0.5]] for now.
- See also: https://flancia.org/go/agora-v1 [[doc]].
- This is a note I will use to track implementation ideas for the v1 of the [[Agora]].
- ~~~The v1 is [[Twitter]] plus [[Anagora]]~~~
- Scratch that :) the v0.5 is:
  - Foam/Obsidian based notes forming a personal digital garden.
  - Hosted in a public or private repository, by default git.
  - Federated/interlinked using a conventional scheme, plus a set of ancillary tools (scripts).
  - Integrated with go links/URL redirectors.
- From conversation with [[dyokomizo]]: would be interesting to track characteristics/traits of conversations as they evolve. Does non-escalation lead to better discourse? Does escalation really lead more often/quickly to violence?
