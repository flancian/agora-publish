# July 4th, 2020
- Thought of the [[Arcades Project]]
- In [[Flancia]] there are [[Arcades]].
- Should I read something by [[Taleb]]?
- [[Yakomo]] told me about [[Foam]] and [[Speech and Language Processing]]
- [[AbstractFairy]] had an idea about a [[Book Club]]. Told me about [[Heather Marsh]]
- Started reading [[Seeing like a State]]
