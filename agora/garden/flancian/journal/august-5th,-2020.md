# August 5th, 2020
- I intend to write [[Caramel City]] today.
- I intend to assemble one piece of Ikea furniture.
- I intend to properly fix the bathroom light fixture.
- [ ] Save recovery code for [[matrix]].
- [ ] Set up [[matrix]] communities.
- Try out [[pentadactyl]] for [[firefox]]. Actually tried "saka key". Decent, but still interferes with some sites more than I'd like and doesn't have a "default off mode" which I'd like. 
- Interacted with [[exgenesis]], [[Juan Jose Fernandez]]
