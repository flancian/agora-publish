# 2020-10-04

 - Yesterday I got roped into some kind of weird Twitter feud and it was *not* my favourite thing. I think I'll try to skip those as much as I can.
 - Had a long, interesting conversation with [[dyokomizo]] about [[communication]], [[models]], [[theory of mind]], [[Buddhism]].
 - TODO for today: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1312463931168813056
   - [ ] VC with family.
    - Scheduling didn't work out.
   - [x] Read Benjamin.
   - [x] Advance the Agora: [[Agora v1]]
   - [x] buy books about [[ADD]]: [[driven-to-distraction]], [[scattered-minds]].
   - [ ] Perhaps I should explore [[zulip]] [[interop]] soon using [[matterbridge]].
    - Didn't get to this, moving to long term TODO.
 - [[ArtVolumeOne]] sent me this [[flan recipe]]: https://organicandrea.com/easy-organic-vanilla-flan/.
 - Found out about [[telekommunism]] in [[theproject.is]]. 
 - [[ablueaeshna]] told me about the concept of privacy in [[A pattern language]]. 
 - [[ding levery]] chimed in with an interesting bit from [[Deep Work]]: https://twitter.com/dinglevery/status/1312849766124929024.
