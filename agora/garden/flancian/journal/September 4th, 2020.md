- [[M. B.]] told me about [[Douglas Adams]]'s Pink Glasses: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_else%27s_problem
- [ ] Yesterday I met [[whomademecrispy]], a [[person]] on [[twitter]]. I should read this: https://twitter.com/whomademecrispy/status/1301301690235117568
- Liked this: https://twitter.com/jolielizabeth21/status/1301315843783929856
- [ ] OK, so I've been procrastinating this for long enough that it seems insurmountable but it clearly isn't: today I finish perf.
- [[Felix Hoesch]] wrote to me from the [[SP]]. Perhaps I could help them translate material to English? Or write in English. Unsure. Something to [[think about]].
- Idea: have a [[think about]] list for non-directed periodical revisiting. Could be spaced repetition I guess; see what [[roamcult]] is doing perhaps?
- I love Roam. The ideas behind it.
- Roam is an Agora.
