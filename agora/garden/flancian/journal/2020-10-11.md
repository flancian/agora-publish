 - Went for a walk, it was great even though it was cold.
 - Trying to organize myself. What exactly do I want to do in this following week, and in which order?
 - Things I know I want to do, regardless of specifics:
   - Set [[intents]]. An intent is a concrete action, often with a physical correlate, that I want to perform in the near future.
     - Example: write on a specific document. Example: flancia.org/go/agora.
   - Set [[invariants]].
     - Example: While the time is between noon and 7pm, I will not be on Twitter.
     - Do I need this extra concept or is it the same as [[intents]]?
 - [[todo]] Agora
   - Move go/agora-v1 to go/agora.
   - Create go/agora-v0.5, make it all about Foam/Obsidian + github + conventions + scripts + go links.
