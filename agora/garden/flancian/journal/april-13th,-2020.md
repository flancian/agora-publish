- Still working on [[Internal Chrome extension]]. I expect to have *something* working in the dev environment today?
- Would like to get started on [[External Chrome extension]].

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[Internal Chrome extension]: ../internal-chrome-extension.md "Internal Chrome Extension"
[External Chrome extension]: ../external-chrome-extension.md "External Chrome Extension"
