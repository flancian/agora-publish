# Gwern
- A [[person]] on [[twitter]].
- Another node I was surprised I didn't have by [[July 20th, 2020]].
- Seems very smart. A role model. He's not as friendly as I hoped, but that might be because he's famous and doesn't have time for random interactions (not judging).
- His work on [[nootropics]].
