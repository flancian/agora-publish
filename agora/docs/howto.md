# How to use this Agora

## To browse it
The simplest way to read this Agora is to browse it online in https://flancia.org/go/agora-rendered. 

## To contribute to it
The Agora is by design a distributed system. The easiest way to contribute is to start taking public notes (that is, growing a digital garden), and then to ask to be included in the digital gardens repository.

The Agora currently targets Foam as its main editor: https://flancia.org/go/foam. The next section details how to get Foam running for the purpose of setting up a digital garden / note taking system compatible with the Agora. If you're already using other note taking tools, like Obsidian or Roam, please scroll down.
